Have you ever find yourself thinking about that place you have been to but cannot recall its name?
Most likely you had a photo there and had been tagged on Facebook, if it is the case, now you have a way to find it!

'I have been to' will help you navigate all places you have been tagged on Facebook. Enjoy!
